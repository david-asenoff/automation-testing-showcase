# 🚀 Automation and Testing Showcase

This repository contains a series of automation scripts and unit tests for various domains, including Facebook automation, API interactions with JSONPlaceholder and SWAPI, math operations, and more. The project is designed to showcase the use of Selenium for browser automation and `unittest` for testing in Python.

## 🛠 Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3.7+ installed. You will also need to install the required Python packages.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**: Ensure that you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **pip**: Make sure you have `pip` installed to manage Python packages.

### Installing Required Packages

Once you have Python and `pip` installed, you can install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install the following packages:
- `selenium`: For browser automation.
- `webdriver-manager`: To automatically manage browser drivers.
- `requests`: For interacting with HTTP APIs.
- `unittest`: This is a built-in Python module, so no additional installation is required.

  - **`oxylabs_automation.py`**: Automation for Oxylabs.
  - **`math_operations.py`**: Contains basic math operations.
  - **`swapi_automation.py`**: Interactions with the Star Wars API (SWAPI).

- **`/tests/`**: Contains unit tests for each domain.
  - **`test_facebook.py`**: Tests for Facebook automation.
  - **`test_jsonplaceholder.py`**: Tests for JSONPlaceholder API interactions.
  - **`test_oxylabs.py`**: Tests for Oxylabs automation.
  - **`test_math_operations.py`**: Tests for math operations.
  - **`test_swapi.py`**: Tests for SWAPI interactions.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: This document, which provides an overview of the project.
- **`presentation_notes.md`**: Contains notes and talking points for presenting this project.

## ✅ How to Run the Tests

### Running a Specific Test

You can run a specific test file by navigating to the project root directory and using the `unittest` module.

For example, to run the math operations tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.math_operations.test_math_operations
```

### Running All Tests

To run all tests in the project:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

This command will automatically discover and run all test files within the `tests` directory.

### Setting the `PYTHONPATH`

In some cases, you may need to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to ensure Python can find the `src` module. You can do this by running:

**On Windows:**

```bash
set PYTHONPATH=D:\selenium\AutomationAndTestingShowcase
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=D:/selenium/AutomationAndTestingShowcase
```

After setting the `PYTHONPATH`, you can run the tests as described above.

## 💻 Usage

Each script in the `src` directory can be run independently. For example, to fetch the title and URL of Facebook's homepage, you would run:

```bash
python src/facebook/facebook_automation.py
```

This will open a Chrome browser, navigate to Facebook, print the page title and URL, and then close the browser.
